# Reading List Client

To get started with this repository, you can run:

```bash
npm install
```

Followed by

```bash
npm start
```

The dev server is set up to run on port 4000 and will proxy fetch requests to `http://localhost:3000`. As you work through the exercise for today (adding authentication to the reading list api) you can use this react client to test out the functionality.
